OS: Developed on Windows 10, using Visual Studio
Compile: None.
Bugs: None.
Summary: My first approach was to use to do some research on MySQL in C++.
Once I had a firm grasp, I then used my old code as a framework and replace 
the instances of file input with SQL queries. Once I got the first add function working,
it was pretty simple to finish up the rest.
